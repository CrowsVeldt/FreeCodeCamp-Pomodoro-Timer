##User Stories from FreeCodeCamp:

  1. I can start a 25 minute timer, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed

  2. I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro

  3. I can customize the length of each pomodoro

##Intended Features:

  2. Play an alarm and pop up a notification when time runs out

  3. A button to start and reset the timer

  4. Input for pomodoro and break length

##Optional additions (if I'm feeling adventurous):

  1. A text input for noting the goal of the current pomodoro

  2. A button to push to add a mark for if the user got distracted, and tally marks for each distraction
  
  2a. The option to add a reason for each distraction, which the user can mouse over to see
  
  3. A selection of alarm sounds
  
  4. The option to save multiple time presets
  
  5. Allow playing sounds at intervals, like a clock's ticking
