#A Pomodoro timer, for the FreeCodeCamp Front End course.

I'm going to use this as an opportunity to introduce myself to writing unit tests, using Jest.


##User Stories from FreeCodeCamp:

1. I can start a 25 minute timer, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed

2. I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro

3. I can customize the length of each pomodoro
