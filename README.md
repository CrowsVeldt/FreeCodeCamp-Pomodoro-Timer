#A Pomodoro timer, for the FreeCodeCamp Front End course.

I'm going to use this as an opportunity to introduce myself to writing unit tests, using Jest.


##User Stories from FreeCodeCamp:

  1. I can start a 25 minute timer, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed

  2. I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro

  3. I can customize the length of each pomodoro

##Intended Features:

  1. A timer, that besides showing time passed will change color and/or fill up to give clearer visual feedback

  2. Play an alarm and pop up a notification when time runs out

  3. A button to start and pause the timer

  4. Input for pomodoro and break length

##Optional additions (if I'm feeling adventurous):

  1. A button to push to add a mark for if the user got distracted, and tally marks for each distraction
  
  1a. The option to add a reason for each distraction, which the user can mouse over to see
  
  2. A selection of alarm sounds
  
  3. The option to save multiple time presets
  
  4. Allow playing sounds at intervals, like a clock's ticking
